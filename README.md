# Weather-Dashboard
## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a page where you could input a city and, using server APIs, retrieve the current weather condtions and a 5 day forcaste which would be displayed on the page.

## Live Deployment link

The live deployment of the site can be found at: https://pletzjd.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage

The site loads with a with an initial location set as toronto as well as loading and previous search history saved in local storage
![initial load](./assets/images/intial_load.png)

Typing a city name in the search area (outlined in red below) will iniate a new search and write the new weather forcast for today as well as the five day forcast. A history section (outlined below in orange) gets the new search added to it at the bottom.

The history section can also be interacted with by clicking one of the past results causing the weather data for that history item to be written to the page.
