# Weather-Dashboard
## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a page where you could input a city and, using server APIs, retrieve the current weather condtions and a 5 day forcaste which would be displayed on the page.

## Live Deployment link

The live deployment of the site can be found at: https://pletzjd.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage

The site loads with a welcome and a description of the rules. There are two clickable buttons under the description of the rules as shown below.

Clicking the start button loads the first question and starts the timer in the top right corner of the page.

Once an answer is selected a new question is displayed. If a question is answered incorrectly 15 seconds is removed from the timer. Once all questions are answered or time reaches 0 the users remaining time becomes their score. The user is shown their score and shown a form to submit their name and score.

When the submit button is clicked the highscore board appears with the newly entered name and score. There are buttons at the botton to reset the highscore board, removing all previously saved scores.

The home button takes the user back to part of the page that was initially loaded. The highscore button on the initially loaded page can be clicked to go to the highscore board
